Hi, thank you for buying okokVehicleShop! :)

1. Go to your database and execute the SQL file named: okokvehicleshop.sql;

2. Open the file 'webhook.lua' and set the webhook link on the line 1;

3. And to finish, you should configure the config.lua file to your liking.

# To add images simply put them in the "web/img" folder with the same id as the vehicle;

# To add vehicles to the vehicle shops you can use the command "vsadmin" (changeable on the config.lua and only available for admins) or add them manualy on your database (table 'okokVehicleshop_vehicles');

# You should use an artifacts version above the version 4752:
  - Windows: https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/
  - Linux: https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_linux/master/
